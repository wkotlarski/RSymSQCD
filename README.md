# RSymSQCD

A C++ code for calculation of NLO (S)QCD corrections in (not only) the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (**MRSSM**).

This code was developed as part of the ongoing research into an R-symmetric SUSY.

### Bulding RSymSQCD

To compile RSymSQCD you need a C++17 compiler (icpc, g++ >= 7.1 or clang >= 5.0).

Location of dependecies can be passed to cmake cmake via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
   viariable. It accepts a `;` separated list of directories. Don't forget to
   escape the semicolon in the shell `\;`!

There is one project specific CMake variable: `OPTIMIZE_FOR_NATIVE` which enables (default is `OFF`) CPU specific optimizations (`-march=native` on GCC or Clang and `-xHost` on Intel).
Use it if you plan to run the code on the same (or reasonably simalar) machine as the one you are compiling it on.
